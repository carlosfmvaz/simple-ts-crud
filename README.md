# simple-ts-crud-api
A simple ts crud using a simple architecture

This app was built using Type ORM and docker with a MYSQL container.
There are only two tables with a simple one-to-many relationship.

The main logic was written inside the controllers, therefore this projects does not follow the best practices of achitecture, like clean architecture or SOLID.
It was written this way just to clarify how does a simple api works in a Typescript environment.
